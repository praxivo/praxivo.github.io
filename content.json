So will need to set that folder as permitted in the cfg, as described above. Doing so the XML data becomes available to download in the browser's default download folder.Interestingly but not surprisingly, a copy of the XML is also placed under &lt;SIEBEL_ROOT&gt;/xmpl/data.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"IP2014","slug":"ip2014","permalink":"http://siebel.blog/public/tags/ip2014/"},{"name":"BI Publisher","slug":"bi-publisher","permalink":"http://siebel.blog/public/tags/bi-publisher/"},{"name":"Integration","slug":"integration","permalink":"http://siebel.blog/public/tags/integration/"}]}]}
